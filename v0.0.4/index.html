            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIGABA is a US cipher machine developed in the late 1930s based on the electromechanical rotor principle. This machine has many names and was known as SIGABA by the US army, ECM (Electric Cipher Machine) Mark II by the Navy, and American Big Machine by the Germans. This machine was developed through the combined efforts of three top US cryptographers: William F. Friedman and Frank B. Rowlett from the Army and Lieutenant Commander Laurence Safford of the Navy [1]. It was first used in the late 1930s and its use was continued well into the 1950s when it was replaced by more advanced machines.
            <br /><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the machine was never broken, the US opted to switch over to more advanced cipher machines in the late 1950's that were quicker and easier to use. This marked the end of the SIGABA's lifetime [1]. To this day, the wiring of rotors have not been published and there have not been any ciphertext only attacks that have successfully broken the cryptosystem of the machine.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the machine is in use and the user selects mode, they can begin typing a message one letter at a time on the keyboard. As each letter is pressed, five signals are sent out. First, signals for the letters F, G, H, and I are sent into the right side of control rotor banks. These signals are scrambled to produce four new letters as they pass through each rotor. The resulting letters are sent through an O-ring which determines which contact points will receive electric signals on the left-most index rotor. From here, the signals are passed through the remaining four index rotors which determine how the cipher rotors will step before encryption occurs. After all of this is complete, the original plaintext letter is sent through the left side of the cipher bank and the resulting signal is the corresponding ciphertext letter. Before the next letter is pressed, one to three of the five control rotors will step forward [2]. The process of deciphering messages is practically identical to how messages are enciphered, but the plaintext is sent through the right side of the cipher rotors instead.
